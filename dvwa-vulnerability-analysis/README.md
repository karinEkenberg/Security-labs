Web Vulnerability Analysis: Command Injection
Description

This project demonstrates the identification and exploitation of a Command Injection vulnerability within a containerized environment. The goal was to understand how unvalidated user input can lead to unauthorized remote code execution (RCE).
Environment Setup

    Target OS: Debian (via Docker container)

    Application: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)

    Deployment: Deployed using Docker to ensure an isolated and reproducible environment.

Execution Flow
1. Discovery and Enumeration

The service was identified running on port 8080. A service version scan was performed to understand the underlying web server.

2. Exploitation

The application's "Ping a device" feature was found to be vulnerable. By appending a shell command separator (;), I was able to bypass the intended functionality and execute system commands.

    Input Payload: 127.0.0.1; whoami

    Result: The server executed the whoami command and returned the system user www-data.

Findings

    Vulnerability: Command Injection

    Impact: Critical. Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to a full system compromise or data exfiltration.

    User Context: The commands are executed under the www-data user, which is the standard service account for the Apache web server.

Remediation

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following best practices should be implemented:

    Input Validation: Use strict allow-lists for user input.

    Parameterized APIs: Avoid using shell-executing functions. Use built-in programming language APIs for networking tasks.

    Least Privilege: Ensure the web server runs with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the impact of a successful breach.
