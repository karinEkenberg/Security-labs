# VSFTPD 2.3.4 Backdoor Exploitation

## Project Overview
This project exploits a malicious backdoor found in the VSFTPD v2.3.4 source code. Unlike a brute-force attack which targets weak credentials, this exploit triggers a hidden execution path in the service itself, granting immediate root access.

## Environment
* **Attacker:** Kali Linux
* **Victim:** Metasploitable 2
* **Tools Used:** Metasploit Framework

## Execution

### 1. Vulnerability Identification
The FTP service was identified as VSFTPD 2.3.4. This specific version is known to have been compromised by an intruder who added a backdoor to the source code archive in 2011.

### 2. Exploitation
The Metasploit module `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor` was used. This exploit attempts to log in with a username containing a smiley face `:)`, which triggers the malicious code to open a shell on port 6200.

### 3. Proof of Concept
A root shell was successfully opened.

* **Command:** `whoami` -> **root**
* **Command:** `id` -> **uid=0(root)**

## Mitigation
1. Update VSFTPD to a secure, signed version immediately.
2. Implement strict egress filtering to prevent servers from initiating reverse connections.
